[MVC Reference](https://iandunn.name/content/presentations/wp-oop-mvc/mvc.php)

* Class files need to have the namespace matching the path directory
* Action callbacks are usually controllers
* Filter callbacks are usually models
* Use output buffering to capture views into a string
* Single callback/view to markup settings, etc.
